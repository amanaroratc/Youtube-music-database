Creates a csv file database for any playlist on youtube

Especially helpful for sharing and creating database of "Liked Songs" on YouTube Music, since the playlist which is created by "liking" the music (on YouTube Music app or website) is not public.

The playlist can be later converted to any other platform using several tools available online, which usually have a paywall to allow converting a "private" playlist from YouTube.

To start, simply press CTRL-A, CTRL-V from your "Liked Songs" playlist page from [here](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=LM) to a new text file.

Further tasks in this project would be to automate the above procedure using web scraping in Python (but why would someone provide their google account login credentials, hmm)
